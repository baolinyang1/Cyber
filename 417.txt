1. Trid is working

Get used to the wget method and unzip them

find '/home/user01/Downloads/go-fuzz-corpus-master' -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ./trid 2>&1 > '/home/user01/Downloads/trid_log.txt' 
-type -f means only check the regular file (not the folder, symlink)
 1. find '/home/user01/Downloads/go-fuzz-corpus-master' -type f -print0

    find: Search for files or directories.

    '...': The path you're scanning — the go-fuzz-corpus-master folder.

    -type f: Only include regular files (not folders, symlinks, etc.).

    -print0: Print each file separated by a null character (\0) instead of newlines. This safely handles filenames with spaces, newlines, or special characters.

✅ 2. xargs -0 ./trid

    xargs: Takes input (from find) and passes it as arguments to another command — in this case, ./trid.

    -0: Tells xargs to expect null-separated items (works with -print0).

    ./trid: The file identification tool you’re using. It'll run once per file found
2>&1

    Redirects stderr (2) to stdout (1).

    This ensures all output (errors + results) go to the same place — useful if you're logging or want to capture everything together.
